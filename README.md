# Diagnostic Reasoning with Large Language Models

## Project Overview
This repository contains work toward building a clinically optimized LLM designed to support diagnostic decisions in real world healthcare settings. The model is fine-tuned using RLAIF and benchmarked on expert-labeled medical datasets such as PubMedQA. Our goal is to create an AI system that responds with clinical precision, minimizes hallucinations and aligns with physician workflows.

## Why This Matters

Diagnostic errors remain one of the most expensive and preventable issues in healthcare, with over $20 billion lost annually in the U.S. due to misdiagnosis. Many general purpose LLMs still struggle with clinical nuance, often generating incomplete, inaccurate or unsafe recommendations. Our work aims to change that by combining:
	•	Fine-tuning on biomedical question-answering datasets.
	•	Model alignment techniques to reflect physician reasoning patterns.
	•	Evaluation against USMLE-style questions and real clinical use cases
