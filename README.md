# LLM_Healthcare
This project builds a medically specialized Large Language Model (LLM) tailored for diagnostic decision support. By combining domain-specific supervised fine-tuning with Reinforcement Learning using AI Feedback (RLAIF), the model is trained to deliver clinically relevant, safe, and explainable responses to complex diagnostic queries.

Using validated QA datasets like PubMedQA, we optimize for factual accuracy, stepwise reasoning, and alignment with real-world clinician expectations.

_Use case:_ In high-burden metro areas such as Chicago—representing ~3.5% of national healthcare expenditure—even modest reductions in diagnostic error could yield over $700M annually in savings and improved patient outcomes.

## Objectives
	•	Develop a clinically aligned, high-fidelity LLM for diagnostic support
 
	•	Enhance reasoning transparency and factual correctness in medical QA tasks
 
	•	Evaluate against domain-standard benchmarks (PubMedQA, USMLE)
 
	•	Model safe and ethical AI behavior for downstream integration in EHR/telehealth systems

## Why This Matters
Diagnostic error remains one of the leading contributors to preventable harm in healthcare, with over $20B in estimated annual costs in the U.S. Despite promising advances in LLMs, many responses still fail to meet clinical standards due to:

	•	Fragmented and unstructured medical knowledge sources
 
	•	Shallow reasoning in generation
 
	•	Misalignment with physician workflows and safety thresholds

This project addresses those limitations through clinically grounded reward design, evidence-based evaluation, and transparent reasoning protocols.
