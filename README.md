# LLM_Healthcare
This project builds a medically specialized Large Language Model (LLM) tailored for diagnostic decision support. By combining domain-specific supervised fine-tuning with Reinforcement Learning using AI Feedback (RLAIF), the model is trained to deliver clinically relevant, safe, and explainable responses to complex diagnostic queries.

Using validated QA datasets like PubMedQA, we optimize for factual accuracy, stepwise reasoning, and alignment with real-world clinician expectations.

_Use case:_ Diagnostic errors cause preventable harm and cost the U.S. over $20B annually, driven by info overload, inconsistent decisions, and limited access to clinical knowledge. Despite AI advances, over 30% of LLM medical answers are inaccurate, undermining trust and blocking safe adoption in clinical workflows. In high-burden metro areas such as Chicago—representing ~3.5% of national healthcare expenditure—even modest reductions in diagnostic error could yield over $700M annually in savings and improved patient outcomes.

*Objectives*
	•	Develop a clinically aligned, high-fidelity LLM for diagnostic support
	•	Enhance reasoning transparency and factual correctness in medical QA tasks
	•	Evaluate against domain-standard benchmarks (e.g., PubMedQA, USMLE)
	•	Model safe and ethical AI behavior for downstream integration in EHR/telehealth systems
