# Healthcare-Specialized LLM with Reinforcement Learning

## Project Overview
This repo explores how to fine-tune a healthcare-specialized language model using medical datasets like PubMedQA, RadQA, and MedMCQA. The goal was to improve performance on tasks like medical question answering and clinical reasoning, especially in situations where accuracy and safety really matter.

We also experimented with Reinforcement Learning with AI Feedback (RLAIF) to better align the modelâ€™s outputs with helpful, factual, and medically sound answers.
