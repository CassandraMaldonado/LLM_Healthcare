# Healthcare-Specialized LLM with Reinforcement Learning

## Project Overview
This repository contains work toward building a clinically optimized LLM designed to support diagnostic decisions in real world healthcare settings. The model is fine-tuned using RLAIF and benchmarked on expert-labeled medical datasets such as PubMedQA. Our goal is to create an AI system that responds with clinical precision, minimizes hallucinations and aligns with physician workflows.
