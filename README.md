# Healthcare-Specialized LLM with Reinforcement Learning

## Overview
This project fine-tunes a biomedical large language model (LLM) for clinical question answering. The goal is to improve factual correctness, diagnostic reasoning, and safety in responses, making the model more suitable for use in healthcare settings.

The training pipeline uses multi-stage curriculum fine-tuning with LoRA adapters and 8-bit quantization, which allows large models to be trained efficiently while maintaining strong performance.

## Motivation

Most general LLMs struggle in biomedical contexts: they hallucinate, miss subtle clinical cues, and donâ€™t generalize well to exam-style or radiology reasoning tasks. To address this, I fine-tuned an open-source LLM using carefully selected medical datasets, aligning the model step by step with expert-like reasoning and safe clinical behavior.

## Datasets

Each dataset contributes something different to the training:

1. PubMedQA: Biomedical yes/no/maybe questions from PubMed abstracts. Good for evidence-based reasoning.

2. RadQA: Radiology QA with detailed rationales. Helps the model learn step-by-step (chain-of-thought) clinical logic.

3. MedMCQA: A large multiple-choice dataset based on medical exams. Useful for memorization and broad factual knowledge.

Combining these datasets helps balance reasoning, recall, and safety in the final model.

## Training Pipeline

The fine-tuning process is organized into stages:

1. Stage 1 PubMedQA: Trains the model on biomedical reasoning.

2. Stage 2 MedMCQA: Strengthens factual recall across specialties.

3. Stage 3 MedQA: Consolidates comprehensive medical reasoning.

_Technical details:_

- LoRA adapters for parameter-efficient fine-tuning.

- 8-bit quantization to reduce memory usage.

- Instruction formatting to convert QA datasets into instruction-following style.

- W&B logging to monitor training progress and metrics.

## Summary
Most general LLMs aren't reliable enough for clinical use they miss nuance, sometimes hallucinate and lack medical context. So for this project, I:

- Fine-tuned a base model (LLaMA) using three healthcare datasets.

- Trained a reward model to score helpfulness and safety.

- Applied reinforcement learning to align responses with expert like answers.

- Evaluated the improvements across different medical QA formats.
